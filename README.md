##### You are a house painter that is available from day 1 . . . n (inclusive). You can only paint one house in a day. It also only takes one day to paint a house. You are given m houses. For each house i, you are also given startDayi and endDayi for i = 1, . . . , m. The house i can only be painted on a day between startDayi and endDayi (inclusive). The given houses are already sorted primarily on startDay and secondarily on endDay (in case of equality of the startDay). You are tasked to find the maximum number of houses that you can paint.
